## My process

I started by separating the content into containers and adding classes to each piece of content. Then I went through and setup the layout using flexbox. I initially tried inserting the image as an img element in the html, but was having difficulty getting it to fill the entire box (it seemed there was always a little extra space at the bottom). Finally I decided to place it as a background img in the css which seemed to work well, particularly as a responsive element. I placed the character "&nbsp;" in the empty img div so that I could add some demention to it.

### Built with

- HTML5
- CSS
- Flexbox

### What I learned

I learned that even when I think something is going to be straight forward, I still inevitably get stuck on something that makes it take much longer than anticipated. I imagine that gets better with experience.
